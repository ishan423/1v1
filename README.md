# 1v1
 we are creating a platform that lets 2 ppl perform a 1vl bw themselves on coding questions taken from codeforces


 to establish connection
    in server side:
        npm run dev
    in client side:
        npm run dev
then open 2 instances of client side localhost port, and in there join the same room, then we can see one side message being sent to other side(tab) indicating that connection is successfully established
